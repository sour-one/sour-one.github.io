  <h2>Little Jungle Gems</h2>
  <p><span class="Frog">Poison Dart Frogs!</span> Dart frogs are some of the most beautiful and amazing little creatures on this planet. Coming from mainly Central and South America these little guys
  are mostly known for thier toxic skin, primarily being used for darts for the indeginious population in the area. These frogs love the humid Rainforest and thrive in damp areas of the forest floors.
In the wild they are extremely poisonious becuase of the small insects that they eat! So luckily for us, since they eat fruit flies, they are not poisonious in the pet trade!</p>
